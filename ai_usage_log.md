Tobey Gray - 12/8/25 - Copilot
What was Asked - How to make spotify play directly in the app using the spotify_sdk
How it was applied - Since the Spotify SDK does not allow developers to directly use spotify in the app, instead opts to allow the app to control the spotify app
Reflection - This confirmed what I was worried about, that you can't play directly play spotify in the app. I tried other methods like using a webview, but that didn't work out, so I had to use the suggested method of externally controlling the actual spotify app.
